# Challenge 3

Now we have the ability to add data to our system, we want to be able to see that information.

Create the **List** component.

It should use either a card style layout, or a table layout to show all the information in the database.

If the data is too long, add previous/next buttons to paginate through the list, to make it easier to view.

If you choose not to paginate, make sure that your header and footer are in front of the cards/table data when scrolling.

You may decide for this that the use of Hooks will be of help, keeping state of the page locations.

OPTIONAL: If you do paginate show the total number of pages and the current page.  Allow the user to type in the page number to go to.

OPTIONAL 2: You may decide to go back and make use of Hooks for storing the state of your data for the database.  You might also decide that a **context** is better for passing the data around.
