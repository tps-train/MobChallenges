# Challenge 1

Create a React app with 4 components;

* Header
* Side Menu
* Main Content
* Footer

Use style sheets to layout the format of your 4 components, according to their naming.  The flex method can be useful for the layout of content.

The side menu just needs placeholders for the moment;
* Home
* Add
* List
* Search
	
The main content page for Home should have an appropriate icon, and a brief description about the project, which is a phone book, or a media library.

The header should contain a logo for your team, and a name for the application.  You can use background colouring, etc to enhance your app and style.

The footer should have a copyright and legal notice as well as a number of total visitors to the site (at this point it can be a state variable, which can reset on screen refresh).
