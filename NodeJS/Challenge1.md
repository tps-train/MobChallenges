# Challenge 1

Create the API that will provide the data for your ReactJS challenge.

Identify the relevant API endpoints you need and HTTP methods required to provide, update and create the data in the Mongo database and to your ReactJS app.

Using **Postman** check that your API calls work and return the correct JSON.

Remember for a list of objects you should see [ ] as the outer most brackets, but for a single object you should see { }.
