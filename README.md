Working in breakout rooms, with one person sharing their screen, create a solution to the challenge posed.  First team back presents and the entire team gets 3 points each.  If your solution meets all requirements a further 3 points per member is awarded.

The team has to explain their code and demonstrate their application, so that everyone understands.

2 further teams can also gain points by demonstrating a different approach, with 3 points being awarded to each member.
